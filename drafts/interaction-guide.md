The Astropy code of conduct (CoC) seeks to create a welcoming 
environment for all. This short guide focuses on common missteps 
in user interaction that can lead to a poor user experience. The
example cases and their complementary responses are meant to train effective 
and respectful communication that adheres to the spirit of the Astropy CoC.

1. No code bashing, directly or indirectly. No scoffing, rolling your
eyes, or questioning users' choices. Everyone chooses different tools
for a reason. If they are not using the same tool you would, use "I"
statements to tell them:

DO NOT SAY:
> "Well, this is a photutils session so you should be using Astropy."

DO SAY:
> "I don’t know how to do that task with IDL, but I can show you how to do it with Astropy photutils."


2. Don’t make assumptions about users' competence or familiarity with
various tools or concepts. Investigate their familiarity by utilizing
a top-down approach. Direct them to perform a task, and if they are
stumped, go one level deeper.

DO NOT SAY:
> "Do you know how to use a terminal?"

DO SAY:
> "Can you open a jupyter notebook session for me?" ... "Okay, open a terminal and type in `jupyter notebook`, then press enter."

3. Do not use the word "actually"

DO NOT SAY:
> "Actually, that’s a good point."

DO SAY:
> "That’s a good point."

The word "actually," in the first sentence, is "used to emphasize that
something someone has said or done is surprising" (Apple
Dictionary). This means you did not expect the person who was talking
to have a good point, which conveys an underlying assumption about
their competence. Eliminate the word "actually" from your vocabulary.


4. If you cannot directly answer someone’s question, direct them to
the appropriate online resource. If they still want your help, assist
them with interpreting the documentation. If there are other people
waiting, respectfully disengage.

DO NOT SAY:
> "Just read the documentation."

DO SAY:
> "Okay, here’s the documentation. There are some people waiting
to be helped. Why don’t you take some time to read this, and when I’m
done helping this other person, let me know if you still have
questions."


5. If a user insists that you help them in a way that you are unable
to, find a respectful way to disengage.

DO NOT SAY:
> "Well, you should be using Anaconda."

DO SAY:
> "I’m sorry, I don’t know how to help you without using
Anaconda." ... "Maybe some one else can help you with that task. How
about asking the question on the #general Astropy Slack channel to see
if anyone else can do it that way?"
