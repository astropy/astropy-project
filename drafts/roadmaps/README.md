This directory contains drafts of Astropy roadmaps.
When these are approved and finalized, they should be posted
somewhere that is not drafty. ðŸ˜‰

# What is a roadmap

A roadmap is a document that concisely lays out the priorities and future
direction of a project or a package (or a category of them), with the
concensus of relevant stakeholders.

Priorities should be separate into three time frames:

* Immediate (e.g., by the next major release)
* Near future (e.g., in the next 2 years)
* Longer term (for anything longer or has undetermined time frame)

Roadmap needs to balance the fine line of not dwelling into every little
details and not being too vague; i.e., needs to be actionable but not to the
point of listing out every GitHub issues.

Roadmap may be used to guide, say, specific project boards, which can contain
specific GitHub issues.

Roadmap needs to be revisited from time to time and updated as appropriate.

# Why do we need a roadmap

A roadmap conveys the Astropy Project's high-level plans and visions to the
community. It is particularly useful when Astropy applies for future fundings.
It can also guide developers from astronomical or scientific institutions,
who wish to contribute, on where to focus their efforts.

# Desired roadmaps

* Project-wide: Sets over-arching goals and may influence other roadmaps.
  This also includes management-related areas, including but not limited to
  governance and finance.
* Core library: Specific to development of `astropy` package.
* Coordinated packages: Specific to packages listed under "Coordinated," though
  each of the package may also have individual roadmaps scoped just to each.
* Learn Astropy: Specific to tutorials, workshops, and related repositories.
* Infrastructure: Specific to packages that support the core library, the
  Coordinated packages, and Learn Astropy, including but not limited to
  `extension-helpers`, `pytest` plugins, and package template.
* Communications: Specific to https://astropy.org website and other
  communication channels.

# What about the Affiliated packages

For Affiliated packages that are not owned by the Astropy organization,
the Astropy Project does not have the authority to set their roadmaps.
They can, however, use the roadmaps here as a guidance, if they wish.

# How do we enforce a roadmap

TBD (Also see: How do we herd cats, some of them unpaid or not paid by Astropy?)

# The process of updating a roadmap

TBD (Astropy Coordination Meetings? Dev telecons?)
