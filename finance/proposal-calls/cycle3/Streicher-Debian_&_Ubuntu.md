### Title

Packaging and maintenance of the Astropy ecosystem for Debian and Ubuntu

### Project Team

Ole Streicher olebole@debian.org/@olebole

### Project Description

This is a proposal to fund the ongoing continuous maintainance and
interaction of Astropy and its related software within Debian, Ubuntu
and other distributions that use Debian as a base. Aside from the
major goal of providing high quality native packages of Astropy within
Debian, this will improve the quality of the Astropy ecosystem by
providing compatibility checks on a wide range of machine
architectures and environments.


### Project / Work

 * keep Astropy in Debian and Ubuntu up to date and in good shape

   - maintain distribution specific patches for Astropy and other packages
    (policy, tests, metadata etc.)

   - fix packaging related bugs

   - observe CI tests and rebuilds on supported platforms and ports for both
     Ubuntu and Debian; report problems and participate in the solution

 * maintain the Astropy related infrastructure in Debian

   - maintain required dependencies

   - follow changes in environment (dependencies, policy); react on new
     incompatibilities and requirements

   - ensure packaging of coordinated packages; maintain them if needed

   - propagate and coordinate packaging of affiliated packages and backports

   - Debian mentorship+sponsorship for affiliated packages if needed

   - observe the packaging of reverse dependencies; help in solving
     compatibility problems

 * act as a link between the Debian distribution and the Astropy community

   - discuss/forward bugs to upstream, backport/apply fixes if needed

   - participate in relevant discussion in both communities, connect
     people for problem solution if needed


### Approximate Budget

Due to the continuous nature of the work, the budget should be based
on a hourly rate. By the experience from the last years, a realistic
estimate would be 8 hours per month. Using a suggested rate of
USD 150/hour, this would sum up to an estimated total of USD 14,400.

This would also be the reasonable maximum, covering the real work that
is done. I would estimate a useful minimum by USD 9,000 (equivalent to
5 hours per month).
