### Astropy workshops for major observatories in Hawaii

### Project Team

The project team will be Pey Lian Lim (@pllim), Matt Craig (@mwcraig), Eric Jeschke (@ejeschke), and Wilfred Gee (@wtgee)

### Project Description

We propose to hold a series of one-day Astropy workshops/open consultation with four major observatories in Hawaii over the course of one week, culminating in a day of open "office hours" by the project team. The details of the content covered at each observatory will be determined by surveying the observatories well in advance. We will initially approach Subaru, Gemini, Keck and CFHT.

The goal of the workshops is threefold:

+ Increase the adoption of astropy (both core astropy and affiliated packages) in the workflow of the Hawaiian observatories.
+ Encourage participation of observatory scientists and developers in the development of astropy and affiliated packages. 
+ Identify priority areas for Astropy development to facilitate adoption of Astropy packages.

### Project / Work


#### Pre-workshop planning

If this proposal is given a tentative go-ahead we will survey Subaru, Gemini, Keck, and CFHT to ask the following:

+ broad topics are of most interest to them (interactive image or spectral analysis, spectral reduction, etc.),
+ workflows they are currently using other software for that they would like to replace or supplement with Astropy packages,
+ areas where they would use Astropy packages if further development were done to meet their needs.

That survey will be completed by mid-September 2023 or within 4 weeks of initial approval, whichever comes first. Dates will be set and the agenda formalized by mid-October 2023.

#### Proposed workshops 

We propose to deliver a series of one-day workshops during one week in February 2024 at four of the major Hawaiian observatories.

The rough outline of each day will be

+ Brief overview of astropy and affiliated packages (30 minutes)
+ More detailed presentation on those areas that the observatories have indicated are of greatest interest to them (2 hours)
+ Lunch (1 hour)
+ Office hours/"code along" help with astronomers and developers to facilitate moving towards an Astropy-based workflow (3 hours)

### Approximate Budget
Currency: US $
The approximate budget should be specified in USD. However, we are open to spending funds worldwide. Budgets should be converted to USD using a plausible exchange rate.

Include overheads, fringe, etc. if money is paid as sub-grant (note that the Moore grant caps overhead at 15%).

- Travel:
  - Round-trip airfare for Pey Lian Lim and Matt Craig: $3,200 ($1,600 each)
  - Car rental in Hawaii: $1,400 ($700 each, for 7 days)
  - Hotel: $3,010 ($215/night/room x 7 nights x 2 rooms)
  - Food: $1,638 (2 travelers * 7 days * $117/person/day -- "overseas" civilian per diem rate[1])
  - Local incidentals: $406 (2 travelers * 7 days * $29/person/day -- "overseas" civilian per diem rate[1])

- TOTAL: $9,654

Please note that we would happily accept budget items other than travel, conference registration, and staff.
