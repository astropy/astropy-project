### Astropy workshops for major observatories in Hawaii

### Project Team

The project team will be Pey Lian Lim (@pllim, STScI), Matt Craig (@mwcraig, MSUM), Eric Jeschke (@ejeschke, Subaru), and Jennie Berghuis (@jplolo, Gemini North)

### Project Description

We propose to hold a series of one-day Astropy workshops/open consultation with four major observatories in Hawaii over the course of one week, culminating in a day of open "office hours" by the project team. The details of the content covered at each observatory will be determined by surveying the observatories well in advance. We will initially approach Subaru, Gemini, Keck and CFHT.

The goal of the workshops is threefold:

+ Increase the adoption of astropy (both core astropy and affiliated packages) in the workflow of the Hawaiian observatories.
+ Encourage participation of observatory scientists and developers in the development of astropy and affiliated packages.
+ Identify priority areas for Astropy development to facilitate adoption of Astropy packages.

### Project / Work

#### Pre-workshop planning

If this proposal is given a tentative go-ahead we will survey Subaru, Gemini, Keck, and CFHT to ask the following:

+ broad topics are of most interest to them (interactive image or spectral analysis, spectral reduction, etc.),
+ workflows they are currently using other software for that they would like to replace or supplement with Astropy packages,
+ areas where they would use Astropy packages if further development were done to meet their needs.

#### Pre-workshop inquiry results

The following observatories were invited to participate. The response from each, if any, is also below. All counts are approximate.

+ *Subaru*: 10 people interested
+ *Keck*: 15 people
+ *CFHT*: A handful will attend an event held at Keck headquarters.
+ *Gemini*: 3-4 software engineers, happy to come to another observatory if too small for their own
+ *SMA*: A small number of engineers would participate, willing come to another observatory.

#### Proposed workshops

We propose to deliver two large workshops, one in Hilo at Subaru and one in Waimea at Keck, with a less formal training session and opportunities for one-on-one help the next day at each observatory.

The rough outline of each workshop day will be

+ Brief overview of astropy and affiliated packages (30 minutes)
+ More detailed presentation on those areas that the observatories have indicated are of greatest interest to them (2 hours)
+ Lunch (1 hour)
+ Deeper dive into additional topics identified in the morning session (1 hour)
+ Office hours/"code along" help with astronomers and developers to facilitate moving towards an Astropy-based workflow (2 hours)

### Approximate Budget
Currency: US $9,654
The approximate budget should be specified in USD. However, we are open to spending funds worldwide. Budgets should be converted to USD using a plausible exchange rate.

Include overheads, fringe, etc. if money is paid as sub-grant (note that the Moore grant caps overhead at 15%).

- Travel:
  - Round-trip airfare for Pey Lian Lim and Matt Craig: $3,200 ($1,600 each)
  - Car rental in Hawaii: $1,400 ($700 each, for 7 days)
  - Hotel: $3,010 ($215/night/room x 7 nights x 2 rooms)
  - Food: $1,638 (2 travelers * 7 days * $117/person/day -- "overseas" civilian per diem rate[1])
  - Local incidentals: $406 (2 travelers * 7 days * $29/person/day -- "overseas" civilian per diem rate[1])

- TOTAL: $9,654

Notes:

- The airfare, car rental, and hotel may a bit less than what is listed above depending on the travel dates.
- Hosting observatories have agreed to provide space for workshops and lunch for presenters.
