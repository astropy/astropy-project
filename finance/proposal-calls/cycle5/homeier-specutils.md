### Project Team
Derek Homeier

### Project Description

#### Roadmap Items
List which [roadmap](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/roadmap/roadmap.md) item(s) this work will help address?
- Functionality

### Project / Work

#### Create functional infrastrucure for multi-Spectrum objects

- Write round-tripping writers/loaders for SpectrumList and potentially SpectrumCollection

- Ensure adherence to standards like IVOA SpectrumDM

- Investigate more efficient data storage options for inhomogeneous collections,
  such as ragged array/awkward-array.

- Participate in Spectroscopy Dev telecons (12 hrs total).

- Correct and improve [loader documentation](https://github.com/astropy/specutils/issues/952)

- Work on [nonlinear multispec formats](https://github.com/astropy/specutils/pull/1199)

### Approximate Budget
currency: US $

- Salary under independent external contractor agreement: 6 hours weekly for 45 weeks,
  a total of 270 hours (accounting for holidays) @ $120 / hour
