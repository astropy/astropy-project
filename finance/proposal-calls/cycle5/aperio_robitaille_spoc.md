### Title

Strategic Planning and Organizing Committee (Robitaille)

### Project team

This proposal is to fund Thomas Robitaille at [Aperio
Software](https://aperiosoftware.com)

### Project description

Thomas Robitaille is a member of the Strategic Planning and Organizing
Committee, and this funding request is to fund participation in weekly calls as
well as carry out related work required outside of calls.

This work would indirectly impact all red and orange items on the roadmap, since
one of the roles of the SPOC is to strategize on how to encourage progress on roadmap
items.

### Budget

The budget assumes an hourly rate of USD 150. Over the calendar year of 2026,
the estimated budget is:

* 42 x 1h calls a year (accounting for holidays, and other unavailability)
* 16h of work outside of calls

In total, this is USD 58 x 150 = USD 8700.

If necessary, the budget could be reduced to just the funding to attend the
calls, which is a minimum for participation in the role to be useful. This would
add up to USD 42 x 150 = USD 6300.
