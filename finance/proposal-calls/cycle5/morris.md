### Broadcasting workshops across space and time


### Project Team
Brett Morris (@bmorris3) will lead the effort.


### Project Description / Scope of Work

We will bring astropy workshops and tutorials to folks across space and time. We will 
update the workshop materials for general use. We will adapt them for shorter, 
live, remote workshops that are easy to attend in various timezones. We will record
many of the tutorials and share the guided tutorial videos.

#### Roadmap Items

This project addresses:
- :red_square: Expand and build on workshop offerings, including online and increased geographic coverage.

#### Project / Work / Deliverables

1. Workshop materials updates: the astropy workshop notebooks have gotten small, continuous
   updates over the years, but three major improvements can be made. The notebooks have not been 
   organized with the goal of helping users navigate to tutorials for different experience levels, so 
   we will split existing tutorials into three sections: novice, intermediate, and advanced. Next,
   the narrative text in the notebooks could be augmented with: more thorough annotation of what the code cells
   do - for users of recorded workshops to help guide themselves,  more links to the documentation for each
   experience level, links to other tutorials from Learn, and notes about helpful astropy ecosystem packages.
   Lastly, attendees at AAS workshops often comment that the full day of tutorials is both too long and not
   long enough. We will prepare tutorials for 2-3 key modules that fit within one hour presentations, so 
   remote workshops are short enough to attend.

2. Remote workshops: we will present the updated materials in at least five remote workshops. The workshops
   will be distributed across different times within the instructor's timezone to accomodate folks in other
   timezones. Most remote workshops should be one hour long, with some more advanced tutorials that should be 
   up to two hours long.

3. Recorded workshop: after the materials are updated and we have practice giving the live, remote workshops,
   we will record a guided tutorial that can be posted online for folks to view asynchronously.
