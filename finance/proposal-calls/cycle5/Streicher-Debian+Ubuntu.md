### Title

Packaging and maintenance of the Astropy ecosystem for Debian and Ubuntu

### Project Team

Ole Streicher olebole@debian.org/@olebole

### Project Description

This is a proposal to fund the ongoing continuous maintainance and
interaction of Astropy and its related software within Debian, Ubuntu
and other distributions that use Debian as a base. Aside from the
major goal of providing high quality native packages of Astropy within
Debian, this will improve the quality of the Astropy ecosystem by
providing compatibility checks on a wide range of machine
architectures and environments.

This project contributes to the roadmap item "Improve support for
using Astropy tools in heterogeneous computing environments such as
cloud environments or GPU systems."

### Project / Work

 * keep Astropy in Debian and Ubuntu up to date and in good shape

   - maintain distribution specific patches for Astropy and other packages
    (policy, tests, metadata etc.)

   - fix packaging related bugs

   - observe CI tests and rebuilds on supported platforms and ports for both
     Ubuntu and Debian; report problems and participate in the solution

 * maintain the Astropy related infrastructure in Debian

   - maintain required dependencies

   - follow changes in environment (dependencies, policy); react on new
     incompatibilities and requirements

   - ensure packaging of coordinated packages; maintain them if needed

   - propagate and coordinate packaging of affiliated packages and backports

   - Debian mentorship+sponsorship for affiliated packages if needed

   - observe the packaging of reverse dependencies; help in solving
     compatibility problems

 * act as a link between the Debian distribution and the Astropy community

   - discuss/forward bugs to upstream, backport/apply fixes if needed

   - participate in relevant discussion in both communities, connect
     people for problem solution if needed

### Approximate Budget

Due to the continuous nature of the work, the budget should be based
on a hourly rate. For the requested period (May 2025 - Dec 2026) the
estimated required time would be 186 hours. Using a rate of USD
120/hour, this would sum up to an estimated total of USD 22,320.

### Period of Performance

This proposal should start with the end of the corresponding ROSES-20
grant and therefore run from 2025-05-01 until 2026-12-31, with a
possible extension by another year.
