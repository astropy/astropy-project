### Title

Release team and shared infrastructure

### Project team

This proposal is to fund the following people at [Aperio Software](https://aperiosoftware.com):

* Thomas Robitaille
* Stuart Mumford

This could also fund other individuals working at Aperio Software as required.

### Project Summary

This project covers:

* Participation in the release team, including carrying out releases in the core package and working on general infrastructure for releases
* Maintenance and development of the shared OpenAstronomy tooling and infrastructure, mainly related to continuous integration and releases

### Project / work

#### Release team

Robitaille is a member of the Astropy project release team, which is responsible for carrying out releases of the core package as well as coordinating release infrastructure across the project and helping improve release pipelines for other packages in the organization. Part of the funding will therefore be used to continue supporting these efforts.

#### OpenAstronomy shared infrastructure

The OpenAstronomy project holds some infrastructure projects shared between Astropy, SunPy and other packages. As part of this proposal Robitaille and Mumford will continue to contribute to and maintain the following projects:

* https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/github-actions-workflows
* https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/build-python-dist
* https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/sphinx-changelog
* https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/publish-wheels-anaconda

This will include collaborating with the Scientific Python project on reducing duplication with their efforts.

#### Link to roadmap

Release efforts are not mentioned in the roadmap because they have worked well in the last few years and therefore are not a priority for improving. However, it is important that release work be funded, otherwise there will not be any releases of the astropy core package.

### Budget

The budget assumes an hourly rate of USD 150. Over the calendar year of 2026,
the estimated effort is:

* 40 hours for regular releases of the core astropy package and other release committee work
* 40 hours for work on the shared OpenAstronomy infrastructure

This gives a total of 80 hours x USD 150 = USD 12,000
