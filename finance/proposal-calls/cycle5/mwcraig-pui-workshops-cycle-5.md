### Astropy Workshops tailored to custom audiences

### Project Team

Matt Craig will lead the effort. Additional participants from the Astronomy/STEM
Alliance with Lick Observatory (ASTRAL), St. Cloud State University, Knox
College, the University of Iowa, the University of Minnesota Morris, the
American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) and the National Solar
Observatory (NSO) will assist with workshop development and delivery.

### Project Description / Scope of Work

This project will deliver a series of workshops customized to the needs of three
distinct groups; workshop materials will be developed for each group. The groups
are:

#### Faculty and students at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs)

Workshops will be developed by and delivered to institutions in the upper
Midwest and the San Francisco Bay Area.

One coordinator at each institution above will be responsible for getting input
from participants regarding topics, organizing the local logistics for in-person
or remote participation, and ensuring participation from their institution.

One graduate student will be hired to develop workshop materials and deliver the
workshop for ASTRAL institutions in the San Francisco Bay Area. Matt Craig will
serve as a technical resource and will review workshop materials.

Matt Craig will lead the development and delivery of the workshops for the upper
Midwest PUIs with input from the local PUI coordinators.

#### Members of the AAVSO interested in learning astropy for data analysis

Workshops focused on using astroquery and astropy to access and analyze variable
star data from a variety of online sources like TESS, ZTF, ASAS-SN and the AAVSO
database. Two motivations for this work are to expose AAVSO members to using
astropy for data analysis and allow them to answer questions about variable
stars they could not otherwise answer. The workshop would be run as a hybrid
workshop in conjunction with the AAVSO Annual Meeting in November 2026.

#### Support astronomers and software developers at large observatories

A workshop will be developed and delivered to support astronomers and software engineers at the National Solar Observatory (NSO), likely in Boulder, CO. This workshop will be adapted from the workshops delivered as part of ALOHA 2024.


#### Organization of the work

The work will be broken up into a few phases:

1. Needs Assessment: Members of each group will fill out short survey with
   follow-up interviews as needed to determine what topics are most relevant to
   them.
2. Workshop Development: Based on the needs assessment, develop workshop
   materials adapted from the existing astropy tutorial materials.
3. Workshop Delivery: Deliver the workshops at 3-5 PUIs, either in-person or
virtually. Each workshop will be led by Matt Craig and the local PUI lead
contact. workshops will be recorded and made available online for broader
access.
4. Evaluation and Feedback: Collect feedback from participants to assess the
effectiveness of the workshops and identify areas for improvement.

#### Relationship to "[Broadcasting workshops across space and time](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/pull/492)"

The work in this proposal is complementary to the "Broadcasting workshops across
space and time" proposal. That proposal focuses on an overhaul of the standard
astropy workshop materials in part to make them easier to deliver remotely and
asynchronously. This proposal focuses on adapting workshop materials to the
needs of specific audiences and delivering those workshops.

We expect that each proposal will benefit from the other.

#### Roadmap Items

This proposal addresses one of the roadmap items under "Learn and User Support":
"🟥 Expand and build on workshop offerings, including online and increased
geographic coverage."

#### Project / Work / Deliverables
Three sets of workshop materials tailored to the needs of each target audience.
In all three cases there is already workshop materials that can be adapted. The
PUI materials will be adapted from the existing astropy tutorials. The AAVSO
materials will be adapted from the PUI materials and an earlier version of the
AAVSO workshops, with additional focus on time series analysis and variable star
data. The observatory support astronomer materials will be adapted from the
workshops delivered as part of [ALOHA 2024](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/wiki/ALOHA-2024).

### Approximate Budget
Currency: US $8,000 - $15,000

- Salary:
    - One graduate student at Lick Observatory or in ASTRAL to develop workshop
      materials: $5,000 for 15 days of work.
    - Local coordinator to work with the multiple participating institutions:
      $1,000.
    - One coordinator each at the remaining 4 institutions: $1,000 each, total
      $4,000.
    - One project lead (Matt Craig) to oversee the project, help develop
      materials, and do some workshop delivery: $5,000 for 10 days of work.

- TOTAL: $8,000 - $15,000

Budget breakdown by audience:

- PUI workshops ($10,000)
  - ASTRAL: $6,000 (one graduate student to develop materials, one coordinator)
  - Upper Midwest: $2,000 - $4,000 (one coordinator per location)
  - Project lead: $0 - $2,000 (material development and delivery)
- AAVSO Workshop ($1,5000): Material development and delivery by project lead
- NSO Workshop ($1,500): Material development and delivery by project lead

- Estimated travel, lodging and venue costs have **NOT** been included in the total above.

### Period of Performance

The period of performance is expected to be Jan 1, 2026–Dec 31, 2026.
