### Astropy Workshops tailored to Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs)

### Project Team

Matt Craig will lead the effort. A lead contact will be identified at each
participating PUI to help coordinate workshop logistics, customize workshop
content, and recruit participants.

### Project Description / Scope of Work
This project will deliver a series of workshops customized to the needs of
primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs). The work will be broken up into a
few phases:

1. Needs Assessment: Ask faculty at PUIs to identify the most relevant topics
and skills for workshops. The groups of faculty that will be asked are those that attended the [SCOPES conference in 2024]() and those that are part of the XXXX in the San Francisco Bay Area.
2. Workshop Development: Based on the needs assessment, develop workshop materials
adapted from the existing astropy tutorial materials.
3. Workshop Delivery: Deliver the workshops at 3-5 PUIs, either in-person or
virtually. Each workshop will be led by Matt Craig and the local PUI lead contact. workshops will be recorded and made available online for broader access.
4. Evaluation and Feedback: Collect feedback from participants to assess the
effectiveness of the workshops and identify areas for improvement.

#### Roadmap Items

This proposal addresses one of the roadmap items under "Learn and User Support":
"🟥 Expand and build on workshop offerings, including online and increased
geographic coverage."
