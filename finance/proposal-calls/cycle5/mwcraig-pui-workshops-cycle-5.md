### Astropy Workshops tailored to custom audiences

### Project Team

Matt Craig will lead the effort. A lead contact will be identified at each
participating PUI to help coordinate workshop logistics, customize workshop
content, and recruit participants.

### Project Description / Scope of Work
This project will deliver a series of workshops customized to the needs of
three distinct groups; workshop materials will be developed for each group. The groups are:

1. Faculty and students at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs)
2. Members of the AAVSO interested in learning astropy for data analysis
3. Support astronomers and software developers at large observatories.


The work will be broken up into a
few phases:

1. Needs Assessment: Members of each group will fill out short survey with follow -up interviews as needed to determine what topics are most relevant to them. The folks at PUIs that will be asked are those that attended the [SCOPES conference in 2024](https://sites.google.com/morris.umn.edu/scopes-conference/scopes-home?authuser=0) and those that are part of the [ASTRAL collaboration](https://www.ucobservatories.org/education/astral-astronomy-stem-alliance-with-lick-observatory/) in the San Francisco Bay Area.
2. Workshop Development: Based on the needs assessment, develop workshop materials
adapted from the existing astropy tutorial materials.
3. Workshop Delivery: Deliver the workshops at 3-5 PUIs, either in-person or
virtually. Each workshop will be led by Matt Craig and the local PUI lead contact. workshops will be recorded and made available online for broader access.
4. Evaluation and Feedback: Collect feedback from participants to assess the
effectiveness of the workshops and identify areas for improvement.

#### Roadmap Items

This proposal addresses one of the roadmap items under "Learn and User Support":
"🟥 Expand and build on workshop offerings, including online and increased
geographic coverage."

#### Project / Work / Deliverables
Three sets of workshop materials tailored to the needs of each target audience. In all three cases there is already workshop materials that can be adapted. The PUI materials will be adapted from the existing astropy tutorials. The AAVSO materials will be adapted from the PUI materials and an earlier version of the AAVSO workshops, with additional focus on time series analysis and variable star data. The observatory support astronomer materials will be adapted from the workshops delivered as part of ALOHA 2024..

### Approximate Budget
Currency: US $

- Salary: $10,000 for workshop development.
- Estimated travel, lodging and venue (**NOT** included in the total below): $8,000 for travel to PUIs, AAVSO meeting and Hawaii observatories for workshop delivery.
- TOTAL: $10,000



### Period of Performance

The period of performance is expected to be Jan 1, 2026–Dec 31, 2026. THe materials will be both developed and workshops delivered during this time.
