### Accessible stellar photometry

### Project Team
Matt Craig will lead the project. Additional participants are XXX.

### Project Description / Scope of Work
This project will focus on a package called stellarphot, which is intended to be an easy-to-use tool for performing aperture astronomy on a set of images. It is written to be run either by a script or via a Jupyter notebook-based interface.

This proposal will do three things:

1. Work with users at primarily undergraduate institutions to improve the usability and accessibility of the stellarphot package.
2. Develop a workshop and tutorials for the package.
3. Add two features to improve performance of the package: i) calibration using an ubercal-style approach that minimizes changes in magnitude across several images over many nights and ii) add the ability to work with and save postage stamps of images rather than full images.

#### Roadmap Items
These roadmap items will be addressed:

+ "🟥 Expand and build on workshop offerings, including online and increased geographic coverage" will be addressed by developing a workshop targeted to smaller observatories/institutions that do stellar photomtery.
+ "🔶 Develop, host, and index tutorials suitable for use in university astronomy courses" will be addressed by creating shorter notebooks in additon to the workshop materials and embedding video help into the notebooks that the package provides.
+ "🟥 Improve support for using Astropy tools in heterogeneous computing environments such as cloud environments or GPU systems" will be addressed by ensuring that it is Array API compliant and by building out the option in `ccdproc` and `stellarphot` to convert full frame images into postage stamp cutouts around stars instead of keeping full images.

### Approximate Budget
Currency: US $

Include overheads, fringe, etc. if money is paid as sub-award to an institution.

- Salary / contractor fees etc. (give sum here, details about contract, payment method (contract/sub-award) etc. can be worked out with the finance committee later)
- TOTAL

Please note that we would happily accept budget items other than the above.

Travel and conference registration should be submitted separately from this funding request, as needed.
