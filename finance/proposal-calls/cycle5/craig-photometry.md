### Accessible stellar photometry

### Project Team
Matt Craig will lead the project. Additional participants are from two members of the Astronomy/STEM Alliance with Lick Observatory (ASTRAL), collaborators from others in the upper Midwest who work primarily with undergraduates, and members of the AAVSO.

### Project Description / Scope of Work
This project will focus on a package called stellarphot, which is intended to be
an easy-to-use tool for performing aperture astronomy on a set of images. It is
written to be run either by a script or via a Jupyter notebook-based interface.

This proposal will do three things:

1. Work with users at primarily undergraduate institutions to improve the
   usability and accessibility of the stellarphot package.
2. Develop a workshop and tutorials for the package.
3. Add two features to improve performance of the package: i) calibration using
   an ubercal-style approach that minimizes changes in magnitude across several
   images over many nights and ii) add the ability to work with and save postage
   stamps of images rather than full images.

#### Roadmap Items
These roadmap items will be addressed:

+ "🟥 Expand and build on workshop offerings, including online and increased
  geographic coverage" will be addressed by developing a workshop targeted to
  smaller observatories/institutions that do stellar photomtery and integrating
  techniques for processing images from smart telescope developed by the AAVSO.
+ "🔶 Develop, host, and index tutorials suitable for use in university
  astronomy courses" will be addressed by creating shorter notebooks in additon
  to the workshop materials and embedding video help into the notebooks that the
  package provides.
+ "🟥 Improve support for using Astropy tools in heterogeneous computing
  environments such as cloud environments or GPU systems" will be addressed by
  ensuring that it is Array API compliant and by building out the option in
  `ccdproc` and `stellarphot` to convert full frame images into postage stamp
  cutouts around stars instead of keeping full images.

#### Project / Work / Deliverables

1. More extensive documentation and tutorials.
2. WOrkshop materials.
3. Improvement of the calibration and postage stamp features.

### Approximate Budget
Currency: US $4,500 - $9,000


- Salary
    - Project lead: $0 - $1,000
    - Additional team members who will help with software development and testing: $4,500 - $8,000
- TOTAL: $4,500 - $9,000

*Note*: if funded at the lower end of the range the funding will be directed to the additional team members rather than the project lead.
