### Title

Development, Coordination, and Community Engagement involving specreduce and other spectroscopy-related tools by Timothy Pickering

### Project Team
Timothy Pickering

### Project Description
This is to continue specreduce development and outreach that was carried out in previous cycles.

### Project / Work
Some specific areas that we expect to tackle during the coming cycle include:

* Automatic wavelength calibration using existing templates (i.e. "reidentify", or "full template" from pypeit)
* Port core functionality from other data reduction pipelines were appropriate
* Improved WCS tools and expanded examples of their use within spectroscopic contexts
* Support for / workflows with multi-object spectrographs
* Support for fiber-based spectrographs, both single and multi-object as well as fiber-based IFUs
* Continued/expanded outreach to observatories and software projects (e.g. PypeIt & DRAGONS) to improve integration and workflows
* Expand outreach to and collaboration with EPRV spectroscopy community
