Astroquery and other maintenance work by Adam Ginsburg

### Project Team
Adam Ginsburg

### Project Description
I will continue working on my maintenance jobs in my role as maintainer of astroquery and the astropy.convolution subpackage.  I will also continue contributing small items to other coordinated packages I'm involved in, including regions and reproject, and affiliated packages, including pyspeckit and spectral-cube.  

On astroquery, my role is primary maintainer of the spectral line databases and general troubleshooter for packages not supported by observatory and archive staff.  I review and curate changes to the user interface.  I also coordinate with several observatories (NRAO/ALMA, ESO) and provide general structural guidance and testing.
