### Title
Astroquery and other maintenance work by Adam Ginsburg

### Project Team
Adam Ginsburg

### Project Description
I will continue working on my maintenance jobs in my role as maintainer of astroquery and the astropy.convolution subpackage.  I will also continue contributing small items to other coordinated packages I'm involved in, including regions and reproject, and affiliated packages, including pyspeckit and spectral-cube.  

On astroquery, my role is primary maintainer of the spectral line databases and general troubleshooter for packages not supported by observatory and archive staff.  I review and curate changes to the user interface.  I also coordinate with several observatories (NRAO/ALMA, ESO) and provide general structural guidance and testing.

I teach observational astronomy and develop and use astropy-learn tutorials for use in those classes.  This cycle, I will refine these tutorials with feedback from other faculty who have used them in the last year.

### Roadmap Items
This program is in light support of several roadmap goals - it does not directly address any, but is needed to enable them.
- 🟥 Improve support for using Astropy tools in heterogeneous computing environments such as cloud environments or GPU systems.

Astroquery will likely be the first point of entry for cloud computing systems, so we need to continuously use and test it on data platforms.  This will be especially important if rate limits and/or port blocking issues specific to cloud systems arise.
  
- 🔶 Improve support for reading and writing spectra using the IVOA SpectrumDM.

Astroquery will be a common entrypoint for users accessing spectra, so it is a key platform for testing SpectrumDM support.  I will add support for the SpectrumDM to pyspeckit and spectral-cube if that is needed, or testing if there is no added implementation needed.


- 🔶 Develop, host, and index tutorials suitable for use in university astronomy courses.

I will continue to develop tutorials (e.g., on spectroscopy, astroquery use) intended for university use.



### Project / Work
