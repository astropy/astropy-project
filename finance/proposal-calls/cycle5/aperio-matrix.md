### Reviving the Matrix Bridge

### Project Team
This proposal is primarily to fund Stuart Mumford at [Aperio Software](https://aperiosoftware.com).
This could also fund other individuals working at Aperio Software as required.

This project requests funding to host a replacement.

This work would fund deployment of a different slack bridge to allow the existing matrix users to keep participating.

### Approximate Budget

As soon as possible to minimise downtime on the slack bridge.
