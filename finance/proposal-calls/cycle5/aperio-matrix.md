### Reviving the Matrix Bridge

### Project Team
This proposal is primarily to fund Stuart Mumford at [Aperio Software](https://aperiosoftware.com).
This could also fund other individuals working at Aperio Software as required.

### Project Description / Scope of Work

As of the end of October 2025 the free hosting of the matrix <> slack bridge the project has been using for a number of years has come to an end.
This project requests funding to host a replacement.

#### Roadmap Items

🟥 Increase inclusion, diversity, and empowerment efforts within the Astropy Project and NumFOCUS communities, and improve our understanding of the demographics of our communities in order to measure the effectiveness of these efforts.

🟥 Ensure people who contribute are from a broad experience base, including typical astronomers.

Having multiple chat platforms increases the people who are going to be willing or able to contribute to the project.
Especially, having an option for one which is not controlled by an increasingly hostile corporate entity should give the project some security going forward.

#### Project / Work / Deliverables

This work would fund deployment of a different slack bridge to allow the existing matrix users to keep participating.

### Approximate Budget
Currency: US $3,000 = 20h @ $150/h

### Period of Performance

As soon as possible to minimise downtime on the slack bridge.
