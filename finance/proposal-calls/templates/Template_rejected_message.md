Hi {RECIPIENT_NAME},

I'm writing on behalf of Astropy's Finance Committee regarding the outcome of your recent Funding Request [PR#{PR_NUMBER}](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/pull/{PR_NUMBER}).

We are sorry to report that your proposal could not be funded during this funding Cycle. We will be closing the FR as a result.

While the community vote was the primary driver of this, it is important to note that this likely does not reflect anything about you as a member of the Astropy Community. Rather, it reflects the specific balance of projects proposed this cycle, the available funds, and the priorities of this cycleâ€™s funding sources relative to others. 

We encourage you to read feedback in the thread above or other feedback you might have received via other means, and consider an FR for the next cycle with whatever modifications you think would help. You are also welcome to reach out to the Finance Committee for feedback if you would like.

{FINANCE_POC_NAME} 
on behalf of the Astropy Finance Committee
