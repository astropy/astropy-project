### Project team

Timothy E. Pickering

### Project Summary

Expand role as specreduce maintainer and work on making it a truly viable alternative for reducing Optical/IR spectroscopic data.

### Project / work

#### Develop and maintain specreduce package

- Roadmap and issues in place to define what is needed.

- Highest priority is to implement what is required for it to successfully be used for simple cases. Having something working to build on will make it easier to pull in more volunteers/developers.

- Shepherd/review PRs as they come in; monitor GitHub issues & Slack channels

#### Work with other spectroscopy-related packages and initiatives

- Work on data structures for 2D or ND spectra will likely intersect with specutils; visualization needs will likely intersect with jdaviz. It is expected that upstream contributions will be required.

- Continue working with the [PypeIt](https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project to help bring it more in line with Astropy standards (e.g. the work I have already done to improve its packaging and testing). Identify methods and algorithms used by PypeIt that would be appropriate to port to specreduce.

- Liaise with other spectroscopic data reduction initiatives such as those at Gemini and LCOGT. Work with them to both help focus specreduce development effort to meet their needs, but also fold existing work into specreduce where possible.

#### Documentation and examples for spectroscopic reduction in python

- Collect existing examples/notebooks and host/organize them within specreduce.

- Create and maintain a python/specreduce version of Phil Massey's famous spectroscopy reduction guide for IRAF. Update this document/notebook as specreduce adds features/functionality.

### Budget
currency: US $

- Target Salary to include all work: $24,000 for 4 hours/week for 50 weeks at $120/hour (negotiable)

- Minimum Salary for maintainance and documentation: $12,000 for 2 hours/week for 50 weeks at $120/hour (negotiable)

- Sub-award also possible to cover my existing salary. This would allow 1-3 months of sustained, focused effort.
