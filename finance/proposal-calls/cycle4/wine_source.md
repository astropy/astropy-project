### Title

Astropy Beyond Astronomy: Wine!

### Project Team

Astropy contributors who are able to work in Baltimore City, Maryland, USA.
In the event of insufficient contributor availability, open hires are also possible.
Contributors/hires must be able to legally work in the USA.

### Project Description

[The Wine Source](https://www.thewinesource.com/) is a fine wine establishment located at
3601 Elm Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21211. It sells wine (of course), beers,
non-alcoholic beverages, and related products. It also offers occasional wine tasting events.
For many years, it serves as watering hole for astronomers and staff from
Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and
surrounding community.
On March 18, 2024, its owner, Mr. David Wells,
[decided to retire and put it up for sale](https://www.wmar2news.com/local/the-wine-source-in-hampden-goes-up-for-sale) and
[listed the property via Mackenzie](https://www.mackenziecommercial.com/property-search/the-wine-source/).

If Astropy takes over this business, the Project will be able to keep
STScI/JHU astronomers happy and also generate stable revenue going forward,
instead of stressing about renewing existing funding sources every few years.
Perhaps, the Project could be even more ambitious and branch out this
business internationally (though that is a proposal for another cycle).

And did I say wine? Unlimited wine... source?

### Project / Work

1. Find a buyer's agent.
2. Place a competitive bid to buy the business via agent.
3. Finalize acquisition and do a press release.
4. Find a lawyer and an accountant to deal with taxes and boring stuff.
5. Straighten out existing inventory and accounting.
6. Offer existing personnel employment at pre-acquisition salary and benefits.
7. Put out additional job offers, as needed. Astropy contributors qualified to
   work in the USA may apply.
8. Do an advertising campaign via a marketing company.
9. Pick a re-opening day with special event/discount.
10. Negotiate a deal with STScI SDAS (current lead: Megan Sosey).
   Perhaps we can offer a discount for their weekly SDAS purchases in exchange
   for annual membership fee. (I don't remember what SDAS stands for but it just
   means "let's drink on the patio every Wednesday at 5 PM.")
11. Negotiate with American Astronomical Society (AAS) to be their exclusive wine supplier.
    If successful, branch out to other astronomical societies but keep it within USA
    for now to avoid having too many lawyers.
12. ???
13. Profit!!! (Funnel that back into business or other Project needs.)
14. If profit comes in too slow, maybe can start to sell some weed too
    on the side. I mean, it is

This is Baltimore, not Albuquerque.

### Approximate Budget

Currency: US $ "a few" million dollars

A hefty upfront investment is needed, but eventually it will turn a profit.

And did I say wine?

### Period of Performance

I am not an accountant but hopefully we will see profit in, like, maybe, 5 years?
