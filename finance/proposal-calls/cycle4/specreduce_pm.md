### Title

Specreduce Project Manager

### Project Team

Kyle Conroy, Kelle Cruz, Patrick Ogle, Camilla Pacifici, Tim Pickering,
Lee Quick, Clare Shanahan, Erik Tollerud, Kyle Westfall.

### Project Description

Coordinate the development for Specreduce with focus on the architecture 
and framework of the package. 

### Project / Work

Developing the next-generation spectroscopic reduction, analysis, and visualization tools
has long been on the [Astropy Roadmap](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/roadmap/roadmap.md), 
but progress has been slow.
The Specreduce package currently sees contribution by a few software developers 
scattered in different places. 
Unfortunately, the organization is not efficient, architectural discussions are rerely
conclusive, and pull requests remain unaddressed for months.

The majority of the development at the moment is in the hands of Pickering at Steward Observatory and 
Shanahan and Conroy at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). Pacifici is a Project
Scientist for JWST at STScI. Pacifici has experience in project management having coordinated the work of the 
development team at STScI since 2020, but they are not a software developer.
Ogle is a Scientist and spectroscopy expert. Quick is the data analysis tools Branch Manager at STScI.
Tollerud, Conroy, and Pickering have been involved in architectural and framework discussions, 
but none of them can devote enough time to the project to converge on decisions. 
Cruz and Westfall have been helping to bring interested parties together and to facilitate discussions.

Here is a list of specreduce improvements and new features to be tackled in the future:
- proper error propagation during spectral extraction,
- build the remaining infrastructure to support wavelength calibration,
- build the infrastructure to support flux calibration,
- include an additional extraction method based on PSF weighting.

The Project Manager we are planning to hire should be a senior software engineer with
experience in spectroscopy. They will push the project forward by:
- integrating the efforts of folks based at different istitutions and with different interests
([JWST data analysis](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis/jwst-data-analysis-software-packages),
[PypeIt](https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/release/),
[DRAGONS](https://www.gemini.edu/observing/phase-iii/reducing-data/dragons-data-reduction-software), etc.)
- proposing solutions for the architectural challanges,
- reviewing pull requests,
- providing test data.
They will also contribute significantly to the code and help craft the next set
of priorities in collaboration with the team.

The hiring committee will be composed by Cruz, Pacifici, Pickering, and Westfall, who will be able
to judge on project management, coding, and community engagement abilities.

### Approximate Budget

For an independent contractor, 36 hours a month (~1 day a week) for 12 months at $150/hour = $64,800.

The minimum viable funding would be 18 hours a month (~1/2 day a week) for 12 months at $150/hour = $32,400.

### Period of Performance

Initial contract will be for one year. Assuming the software engineer is successful in the role, we anticipate needing 2 years of effort.
