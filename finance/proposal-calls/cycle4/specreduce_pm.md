### Title

Specreduce Project Manager

### Project Team

- Tim Pickering, Camilla Pacifici, Clare Shanahan, Kelle Cruz, ...

### Project Description

Coordinate the development for Specreduce with focus on the architecture 
and framework of the package. 

### Project / Work

The Specreduce package currently sees contribution by a few software developers 
scattered in different places.
Unfortunately, the organization is not efficient and the progress is very slow.

We ask to fund a software engineer to:
- take the lead on Specreduce architecture, proposing solution and helping clearing road blocks;
- manage the contribution by other developers in a timely manner.

### Approximate Budget

Still iterating on this...

### Period of Performance

2 years, starting May 2024
