Specreduce Project Manager

### Project Team

Kyle Conroy, Kelle Cruz, Patrick Ogle, Camilla Pacifici, Tim Pickering,
Clare Shanahan, Erik Tollerud, Kyle Westfall, +?

### Project Description

Coordinate the development for Specreduce with focus on the architecture 
and framework of the package. 

### Project / Work

The Specreduce package currently sees contribution by a few software developers 
scattered in different places. 
Unfortunately, the organization is not efficient, architectural discussions are rerely
conclusive, pull requests remain unaddressed for months, and the progress is very slow.

We ask to fund a software engineer to:
- take the lead on Specreduce architecture, proposing solution and helping clearing road blocks;
- manage the contribution by other developers in a timely manner.

The majority of the development at the moment is in the hands of Pickering at Steward Observatory and 
Shanahan and Conroy at the Space Telescope Science Institute. Pacifici is a Project
Scientist who coordinates the work on the Space Telescope side for the suite of data analysis tools
developed there. Ogle is a Scientist and spectroscopy expert.
Tollerud, Conroy, and Pickering have been involved in architectural and framework discussions, 
but none of them can devote enough time to the project to converge on decision.
Others...

Here is a list of improvements and new features to be tackled in the future:
- proper error propagation during spectral extraction,
- build the remaining infrastructure to support wavelength calibration,
- build the infrastructure to support flux calibration,
- include an additional extraction method based on PSF weighting.

The Project Manager we are planning to hire will push the project forward, proposing
solutions for the architectural challanges, reviewing pull requests, and providing test
data. They will also contribute significantly to the code and help craft the next set
of priorities in collaboration with the team.
