### Astronomical Data Science Workshops

### Project Team

The team consists of a the members of the Advisory Comittee for the Carpentries Astronomical Data Science curriculum. This group has been meeting semi-annually for the last 2 years in order to oversee the development of these materials. Several members of the committee were heavily engaged in the development of the curriculum via an APS grant. Most of the committee members are trained Carpentries instructors and have delivered workshops using these materials at different venues including the AAS meetings.

The members of the Advisory Comittee currently are:
Adam Hughes
Azalee Bostroem
Brett Morris
Ivelina Momcheva
Meredith Rawls
Phil Rosenfield
Rachel McClure

Azalee Bostroem has organized the winter AAS workshops using this curriculum for the last 4 years. 
-  Begin by introducing the primary project coordinator(s) or organizer(s), highlighting their background in data science, astronomy, and education.
- Mention any specific roles of team members, such as curriculum development, logistics, or instruction.
- Include a brief note on how the team's composition supports the workshop's objectives and how their expertise will ensure the delivery of high-quality training.

### Project Description

In this proposal we request funding to carry out two workshops within the next 12 months at conferences which bring together minotiry researchers. The events we are targetting are:

- 2024 NDISTEM Conference organized by SACNAS, Oct 31st - Nov 2nd in Phoenix, AZ
- NSBP and National Society of Hispanic Physicists 2024 Annual Conference in Houston, TX in November 2024

Our Astronomical Data Science Workshops aim to empower undergraduate students, early-career researchers, and educators in astronomy with critical data science skills, focusing on the Foundations of Astronomical Data Science curriculum. This curriculum is designed to equip learners with the abilities to handle large astronomical datasets, perform advanced database operations such as SQL queries, joins, and filtering, and produce publication-quality data visualizations. Over approximately 10 hours, participants will delve into software packages widely used in data science, including Pandas for data management, Astropy for astronomy-specific tasks, and Astroquery for accessing remote databases.

The hands-on curriculum leverages two major astronomical datasets: the Gaia satellite's billion-star catalog and the Pan-STARRS photometric survey. These resources allow participants to engage directly with real-world astronomical phenomena, such as the GD-1 stellar streamâ€”a globular cluster stretched into an arc by the Milky Way's gravitational forces. Through a guided exploration, participants will reproduce parts of a significant analysis on GD-1, learning to identify and visualize this stream while gaining insights into the mass of the Milky Way and the intriguing gaps within the stream caused by dark matter interactions.

The workshop emphasizes practical skills like crafting complex queries, managing data with Pandas DataFrames and Astropy Tables, and customizing detailed plots. Furthermore, it introduces best practices in creating reproducible workflows and transforming coordinates between common systems, enhancing both the efficiency and impact of astronomical research. This initiative aligns closely with the goals of the Astropy project, promising to enrich the astronomical community's capabilities in data science and open new avenues for discovery and analysis.

### Project / Work

Our project encompasses the organization and execution of two comprehensive 2-day workshops, each designed to accommodate approximately up to 50 participants. 

The team required is 2 instructors and 2 helpers. The instructors will be recruited from the team above + several other trained instrctors. Helpers are usually recruited locally form the city where the event is, either from local astronomy departments or the local Carpentries community. 

2 instructors are needed because 10 hours of content is too much to be delivered by a single instructor. 

### Approximate Budget

Overall organization will be done by the team on our own time. The expenses we request support include:

- Travel:
- Conference registraion:
- Materials:
- Room reservation:
- Refreshments: 

Currency: US $
TOTAL: 

### Period of Performance

The period of performance is 1 year.
