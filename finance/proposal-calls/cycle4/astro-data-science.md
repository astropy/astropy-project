### Astronomical Data Science Workshops

### Project Team

The team consists of a the members of the Advisory Comittee for the Carpentries Astronomical Data Science curriculum. This group has been meeting semi-annually for the last 2 years in order to oversee the development of these materials. All of these members are at the intersection of the Carpentries community, open-source astronomy community, and the astronomical data science community. Most of the committee members are trained Carpentries instructors and have delivered workshops using these materials at different venues including the AAS meetings.

The members of the Advisory Comittee currently are:
- **Azalee Bostroem** has been involved with this curriculum since its inception as a co-PI on the APS venture partnership grant which funded its development. She lead the development effort and served as a lesson maintainer for its first year as an official Carpentries Curriculum. She is now the chair of the curriculum advisory committee and organizes and instructs workshops, including at AAS meetings. She will help organize the workshops in this proposal and instruct as needed.
- **Ivelina Momcheva** helped organized a pilot workshop at STScI and was lead instructor at the summer 2022 AAS meeting workshop. She will help organize the workshops in this proposal.
- **Adam Hughes** is an astronomer turned data scientist. He has been an instructor at the winter and summer 2022 AAS meeting and a pilot workshop at STScI. He is a potential instructor for the workshops in this proposal.
- **Meredith Rawls** has served as a helper at the first pilot workshop of this curriculum and as an instructor at the Winter 2022 AAS meeting.  She is a potential instructor for the workshops in this proposal.
- **Heather Andrews Mancilla** is the secretary of the curriculum advisory committee and helped organize a pilot workshop at the eScience center in Delft. She will help organize the workshops in this proposal.

Additional support: the curriculum lesson maintainers are also potential instructors for these workshops.
- **Rodolfo Montez** was co-PI of the APS grant that funded this curriculum and part of the team that guided its development. He was an instructor at the first pilot workshop.
- **Ralf Kotulla** has instructed at the winter 2023 and 2024 AAS workshops. 

- Mention any specific roles of team members, such as curriculum development, logistics, or instruction.
- Include a brief note on how the team's composition supports the workshop's objectives and how their expertise will ensure the delivery of high-quality training.

### Project Description

In this proposal we request funding to carry out two workshops within the next 12 months at conferences which bring together minotiry researchers. The events we are targetting are:

- 2024 NDISTEM Conference organized by SACNAS, Oct 31st - Nov 2nd in Phoenix, AZ
- NSBP and National Society of Hispanic Physicists 2024 Annual Conference in Houston, TX in November 2024

Our Astronomical Data Science Workshops aim to empower undergraduate students, early-career researchers, and educators in astronomy with critical data science skills, focusing on the Foundations of Astronomical Data Science curriculum. This curriculum is designed to equip learners with the abilities to handle large astronomical datasets, perform advanced database operations such as SQL queries, joins, and filtering, and produce publication-quality data visualizations. Over approximately 10 hours, participants will delve into software packages widely used in data science, including Pandas for data management, Astropy for astronomy-specific tasks, and Astroquery for accessing remote databases.

The hands-on curriculum leverages two major astronomical datasets: the Gaia satellite's billion-star catalog and the Pan-STARRS photometric survey. These resources allow participants to engage directly with real-world astronomical phenomena, such as the GD-1 stellar streamâ€”a globular cluster stretched into an arc by the Milky Way's gravitational forces. Through a guided exploration, participants will reproduce parts of a significant analysis on GD-1, learning to identify and visualize this stream while gaining insights into the mass of the Milky Way and the intriguing gaps within the stream caused by dark matter interactions.

The workshop emphasizes practical skills like crafting complex queries, managing data with Pandas DataFrames and Astropy Tables, and customizing detailed plots. Furthermore, it introduces best practices in creating reproducible workflows and transforming coordinates between common systems, enhancing both the efficiency and impact of astronomical research. This initiative aligns closely with the goals of the Astropy project, promising to enrich the astronomical community's capabilities in data science and open new avenues for discovery and analysis.

More about diversity and inclusion.
- conferences we're choosing
- Carpentries: inclusive community, open-access curriculum

More about connection to astropy.
- introducing astropy and its affiliated packages to a more diverse community, attracting contributers and users from that community
- astropy packages: coordinates, units, Tables, in the context of an astronomical workflow and big data tools that are coming with surveys that are on the horizon

### Project / Work

Our project encompasses the organization and execution of two comprehensive 2-day workshops, each designed to accommodate approximately up to 50 participants. 

The team required is 2 instructors and 2 helpers. The instructors will be recruited from the team above + several other trained instrctors. Helpers are usually recruited locally form the city where the event is, either from local astronomy departments or the local Carpentries community. 

2 instructors are needed because 10 hours of content is too much to be delivered by a single instructor. 

### Approximate Budget

Overall organization will be done by the team on our own time. We plan to hold two workshops. For each workshop we assume 50 participants, two instructors, and two helpers. We assume instructors will require airfare, three nights hotel, and M&I, while helpers are assumed to be local. For each workshop, we request  support for:
Total per workshop: $10,000 
- Travel: $2000 per instructor ($4000 total)
- Conference registraion:
    * $725 (professional registration for instructors; $1450 total)
    * $450 (student registration for helpers; $900 total)
- Venue (incl. A/V support): $1650
- Refreshments: $20/person/day ($2000 total)

Currency: US $
TOTAL: 20,000

### Period of Performance

The period of performance is 1 year.
