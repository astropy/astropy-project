### Title
Astroquery and other maintenance work by Adam Ginsburg

### Project Team
Adam Ginsburg

### Project Description
I will continue working on my maintenance jobs in my role as maintainer of astroquery and the astropy.convolution subpackage.  I will also continue contributing small items to other coordinated packages I'm involved in, including regions and reproject, and affiliated packages, including pyspeckit and spectral-cube.  

On astroquery, my role is primary maintainer of the spectral line databases and general troubleshooter for packages not supported by observatory and archive staff.  I review and curate changes to the user interface.



### Project / Work
This proposal includes maintenance work and supervision of any enhancement projects on the above-mentioned packages

### Approximate Budget
Currency: US $10,500
- $10294 to cover 1 CM of effort by Ginsburg.  
- $4118 for fringe/benefits
- $1441 overhead (at Moore's upper limit of 10%; UF standard is 52.5%)

Should be awarded using the same mechanism as in previous cycles (subaward).

This requested budget, 1 CM of effort, is the minimum viable.

### Proposed Budget
$15,853
