The approximate budget should be specified in USD. However, we are open to spending funds worldwide. Budgets should be converted to USD using a plausible exchange rate.

Include overheads, fringe, etc. if money is paid as sub-grant (note that the Moore grant caps overhead at 15%).

- Salary / contractor fees etc. (give sum here, details about contract, payment method (contract/sub-award) etc. can be worked out with the finance committee later)
- TOTAL

Please note that we would happily accept budget items other than the above.

Travel and conference registration should be submitted separately as needed.

List the expected range of time the budget should be allocated for.  Note that if this is longer than one year, funds beyond that horizon are contingent on funds from the project being available (feel free to ask the finance committee if you have any concerns about this).
