# Call for proposals: Inclusion, Diversity, and Empowerment

We recognize that contributing to open source projects is a privilege not available to everyone and that the Astropy Project community is highly white, predominantly male, and is homogeneous in several other ways, too. In our [code of conduct](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html), we committed to being an inclusive and welcoming community, but clearly it’s not enough to write down a commitment, there needs to be action too. Hence, we urge all Astropy community members to take action to broaden participation in the Project at all levels and we want to empower those actions.

Often, such actions require resources and thus the Project asks for proposals from members of the community for up to $15,000 for any action that helps with inclusion, support, and empowerment of underrepresented or marginalized groups in the Astropy community. We are looking for proposals that lead to concrete actions soon, preferably in the next six months. 

We envision an open and collaborative process for proposals and the proposal review, where ideas are opened as pull requests in the astropy/project repo (see template below), similar to the way APEs are suggested, discussed and improved. That way any community member can comment on, flesh out, add details to, and improve proposals. Similar to hack day pitches, proposers do not need to have the needed team already assembled and we envision the proposal process as an opportunity for teams to be recruited and formed.

We hope that an open discussion will encourage people with similar ideas to join forces and that the community will converge on one or two proposals to be supported. This relies on community members to provide honest and constructive feedback and input to see which proposals can be realistically executed with the resources we have and have the most positive impact.

If there is no consensus by end of August, the following process will be used to decide: The CoCo will select 4-5 proposals that are (i) fundable through the Moore grant, (ii) fleshed out in enough detail that work and funding can happen on a six-month time scale, and (iii) have the most community buy-in (counting number of contributors and positive comments in the PR from distinct people).  We will then invite the community to comment on those proposals specifically and, should a tie-break be necessary, the CoCo will make a decision on September 15th.

This initiative was inspired by recent events in the US, but we stress that proposals may target any  underrepresented or marginalized groups worldwide and Project-specific challenges. We also want to emphasize that proposals can be outward facing (e.g., focusing on recruitment) or inward facing (e.g., working on existing practices in our community which may be exclusionary).  

Funding for this comes from the Moore grant to the Astropy Project, which includes $15,000 for “mentoring” in the budget year Nov 2019 to Oct 2020, thus one or more proposals with a total cost of $15,000 can be funded. For proposals that do not fit under the “mentoring” proposed in the Moore grant, the finance committee will try to find alternative funds. Likely, that will require to shift other spending between budget items and thus the total cap of $15,000 still applies.

Think of this like a hack day pitch or a github issue for discussion, not like a funding  proposal to a government agency. Short and informal is encouraged.

# Title
Telescope Coordination for Time Domain Astronomy Project with Pan-African School for Emerging Astronomers (PASEA) Alumni

## Summary 
This project is to give coding training and research experience to PASEA alumni, in particular, I'd like to supervise a student to develop tools to schedule simultaneous observations of telescopes from around the globe and in space. 
PASEA has run all expenses paid 4 week-long summer schools for African undergraduate and postgraduate students in STEM (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019), and we now have 250 alumni from over 10 different African countries.
PASEA alumni are an engaged cohort and continue to send daily messages in a WhatsApp group, where they share their continued experiences in STEM, and in particular astronomy, as well as promote opportunities for all alumni. 

## Team 
The PASEA team has about 20 astronomers from all around the world, a subset of these would be interested in putting together some coding training resources. A subset of this team would be interested in mentoring students for research projects, including myself. 
We would love help in creation or gathering of Jupyter Notebooks that can be used for training. Extra help would be appreciated in figuring out where a Jupyter hub can be hosted, and setting that up so students don't need their own computing resources.   

## Plan
First step is to recruit students. Students will experience one or both of the following:

Student experience: Students do python training over 1 week, relevant to the research project they will work on. It would be great if students can do this via a Jupyter hub so they don't need their own computing resources and just need internet and a laptop. 
Action to enable experience: Find host for Jupyter hub and set it up; Project supervisor help determine content of this training, which should be relevant to the research project student is to undertake. Find tutors who can help students while they do this, the number of students recruited will be proportional to the number of tutors (e.g. 1 tutor/5 students). 

Student experience: Students use python training to do research project.
Action to enable experience: Supervisor and student interact few times a week over a 3 month (full time preferable) internship. Follow this with less frequent interactions to finish the project off part time. The number of students recruited for this section would depend on the number of relevant projects, as well as available funding. Students would be selected based on engagement in PASEA, their career goals, and engagement in the 1 week python training. I would like to supervise a student to put together python tools for observing scheduling when multiple telescopes all around the globe, as well as in space, are used simultaneously. This type of observing runs are typical of the Deeper Wider Faster Project, which aims to catch the fastest bursts in the Universe and discern their nature (bursts such as fast radio bursts and kilonovae).

## Impact
African undergraduate and graduate students will get python training, do research and contribute to python tools that help schedule and coordinate telescopes for time domain astronomy.

## Budget
1. $450/week stipend for student for 3 months of full time internship to do research project. ($5,800/student who does research project)
2. $200 for 1 zoom license
3. $100/student for mobile internet so student can participate online throughout the internship. ($100/student who does research project)
4. $20/student for mobile internet so student can participate online for python workshop over 1 week ($20/student who attends python workshop)
