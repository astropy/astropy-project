# Title
Telescope Coordination for Time Domain Astronomy Project with Pan-African School for Emerging Astronomers (PASEA) Alumni

## Summary 
This project is to give coding training and research experience to PASEA alumni, in particular, I'd like to supervise a student to develop python tools to schedule simultaneous observations of telescopes from around the globe and in space. 
PASEA has run all expenses paid 4 week-long summer schools for African undergraduate and postgraduate students in STEM (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019), and we now have 250 alumni from over 10 different African countries. PASEA alumni are an engaged cohort and continue to send daily messages in a WhatsApp group, where they share their continued experiences in STEM, and in particular astronomy, as well as promote opportunities for all alumni. See https://www.astrowestafrica.org/home for more information on PASEA. 

## Team 
The PASEA team has about 20 astronomers from all around the world, a subset of these would be interested in putting together some coding training resources. A subset of this team would be interested in mentoring students for research projects, including myself. 
We would love help in creation or gathering of Jupyter Notebooks that can be used for training. Extra help would be appreciated in figuring out where a Jupyter hub can be hosted, and setting that up so students don't need their own computing resources.   

## Plan
First step is to recruit students. Students will experience one or both of the following:

Student experience: Students do python training over 1 week, relevant to the research project they will work on. It would be great if students can do this via a Jupyter hub so they don't need their own computing resources and just need internet and a laptop. 
Action to enable experience: Find host for Jupyter hub and set it up; Project supervisor help determine content of this training, which should be relevant to the research project student is to undertake. Find tutors who can help students while they do this, the number of students recruited will be proportional to the number of tutors (e.g. 1 tutor/5 students). 

Student experience: Students use python training to do research project.
Action to enable experience: Supervisor and student interact few times a week over a 3 month (full time preferable) internship. Follow this with less frequent interactions to finish the project off part time. The number of students recruited for this section would depend on the number of relevant projects, as well as available funding. Students would be selected based on engagement in PASEA, their career goals, and engagement in the 1 week python training. I would like to supervise a student to put together python tools for observing scheduling when multiple telescopes all around the globe, as well as in space, are used simultaneously. This type of observing runs are typical of the Deeper Wider Faster Project, which aims to catch the fastest bursts in the Universe and discern their nature (bursts such as fast radio bursts and kilonovae).

## Impact
African undergraduate and graduate students will get python training, do research and contribute to python tools that help schedule and coordinate telescopes for time domain astronomy.

## Budget
1. $450/week stipend for student for 3 months of full time internship to do research project. ($5,800/student who does research project)
2. $200 for 1 zoom license
3. $100/student for mobile internet so student can participate online throughout the internship. ($100/student who does research project)
4. $20/student for mobile internet so student can participate online for python workshop over 1 week ($20/student who attends python workshop)
