# Title: Coding and Research Experience for Pan-African School for Emerging Astronomers (PASEA) Alumni

## Summary 
This project is to give coding training and research experience to PASEA alumni, who are African undergraduate and graduate students in STEM. In particular, I'd like to supervise a student to develop open source python tools to schedule simultaneous observations of telescopes from around the globe and in space.  

## Team 
PASEA has run 4 week-long summer schools for African undergraduate and postgraduate students in STEM (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019). We now have 250 alumni from over 10 different African countries. PASEA alumni are an engaged cohort and continue to send daily messages in a WhatsApp group related to STEM, astronomy and opportunities. See https://www.astrowestafrica.org/home for more information on PASEA.

The PASEA instructional team has about 20 astronomers from all around the world, a subset of these would be interested in putting together some coding training resources. A few of us are interested in mentoring students for research projects, including myself. 

We would love help in the creation or gathering of Jupyter Notebooks that can be used for training. Extra help would be appreciated in figuring out where a Jupyter hub can be hosted, and setting that up so students don't need their own computing resources.   

## Plan
1. Run python training over 1 week, relevant to the proposed research project. 
1a) Set up JupyterHub so students don't need their own computing resources and just need internet and a laptop. 
1b) Project supervisor help determine content of this training, which should be relevant to the research project(s) student can choose from. 
1c) Find tutors who can help students during the training week (e.g. 1 tutor/5 students). 
1d) Recruit students based on their career goals and engagement in PASEA.

2. Students do astronomy research project.
2a) Recruit students for research project(s). Students would be selected based on their career goals, as well as engagement in PASEA and the 1 week python training.
2b) Supervisor and student interact few times a week over a 3 month (full time preferable) internship. 
2c) Follow this with less frequent interactions to finish the project off part time. 
2d) Note: I would like to supervise a student to put together open source python tools for observing scheduling/ telescope coordination when multiple telescopes all around the globe, as well as in space, need to be used simultaneously. This type of observing runs are typical of the Deeper Wider Faster Project, which aims to catch the fastest bursts in the Universe and discern their nature (bursts such as fast radio bursts and kilonovae). These open source tools can be published in https://joss.theoj.org. 

## Impact
African undergraduate and graduate students will get python training, do research and contribute to open source python tools that help schedule and coordinate telescopes for time domain astronomy. 

Four PASEA alumni are now PASEA instructors. This is a great avenue to identify more PASEA alumni who can be PASEA instructors. Having instructors who were once participants of the school is highly motivating and a huge boost for self-efficacy.

## Budget
1. $450/week stipend for student for 3 months of full time internship to do research project. ($5,800/ research project student)
2. $200 for 1 zoom license
3. $100/student for mobile internet so student can participate online throughout the internship. ($100/ research project student)
4. $20/student for mobile internet so student can participate online for python workshop over 1 week ($20/ python workshop student)
