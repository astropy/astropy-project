Dear [INSERT CONTACT AT MOORE FOUNDATION],

thank you so much for giving the grant "Sustaining and Growing the Astropy
Project" to us. As you know from the grant application, we are still working
out a formal government and management structure, because the astropy project
has not received grants like this before.

However, many astropy members are used to government issued contracts and
grants (e.g. NSF, NASA) from their non-astropy science work, where every grant
comes with a separate set of rules.

We'd thus like to clarify a few points about timeline and spending about the
Moore grant early on - in particular since you awarded us more money than we
originally budgeted and we are trying to decide now, how that extra money will
benefit the project most.

- We proposed work over three years of time. When did the clock for that
  formally start?  

- We are keen to get the work done, but if we don't spend
  the money as fast as we thought we would, could the grant period be extended,
  e.g. by another year?  

- For the application, we estimated a budget and broke that down into different
  sub-categories. Obviously, the costs won't come in exactly like that to the
  cent. Do you have a guideline for us like "if you shift more than XX k$ from
  category A to category B, please check with us in advance"?


Yours sincerely,
