Dear all,

As Erik announced back in December [1], the Coordination Committee has
established a new Interim Finance Committee. The new committee is charged with
overseeing the distribution of Astropy's funds. The idea is that this committee
is temporary, and will be replaced when the project decides on a new governance
structure.

This committee has now been convened with the following membership:

- Kelle Cruz
- Moritz Guenther
- John Swinbank
- Erik Tollerud
- Steve Crawford (Ombudsperson)

We think it's important that this new committee be open and transparent about
its business. To that end, we wanted to take a moment to fill you in on how the
committee is going about its business, and how you can follow along and provide
comments and suggestions.

First, we've estabished a wiki page:

  https://github.com/astropy/project/wiki/Financial-Management

That page has the full charge to and membership of the committee, as well as
links to key resources and information about how to contact us. We'll make sure
it's kept up to date as and when any of this changes.

The committee meets weekly. We keep running notes on those meetings, which are
publicly available — we welcome your comments on them:

We track the committee's business in the astropy/project repository. You can see
what we're working on, or file issues for us to think about, here:

  https://github.com/astropy/project/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22finance+%3Amoneybag%3A%22

Finally, you can get in touch with is directly in #finance-committee on Slack,
or by sending mail to finance@astropy.org.

We're excited to be able to help out Astropy in this way, and we'd love to hear
your feedback.

Cheers,

John
On behalf of the Interim Finance Committee
