Role and responsibilities of the Committee

#. The Committee should notify the Coordination Committee where they believe the priorities set by the latter may not be aligned with the views of the wider community.
   This is particularly important when members of the Committee may, as part of Committee business, have access to information which is not available to the community at large.

   (Agreed `2020-02-07`__.)

#. The Committee will allocate funding as recommended by the Astropy Coordination Committee, and will consider funding requests submitted according to the policy documented at https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/finance/funding_requests.md.
   This policy may be evolve over time.

   (Agreed `2020-04-24`__.)

#. The scope of the Committee is not limited to any particular source of funding; rather, the Committee is charged with maintaining an oversight on — and, where appropriate, direct management of — all Astropy-controlled funding instruments.
   In the event that external bodies wish to provide support to Astropy that is not directly financial (for example, by employing somebody to work on Astropy), the Committee need not be consulted or otherwise involved, but will be available to assist with the process upon request.

   (Agreed `2020-06-26`__.)

#. Attendance at or participation in Committee meetings is by invitation only.

   This is necessary to respect the privacy of persons whose personal details may be discussed at the meeting.

#. Committee meetings will be organized by a moderator.

   The moderator will moderate the discussion in the meeting and make sure the agenda is followed.

   After the meeting is complete, the moderator is responsible for recording decisions taken and preparing the agenda for the next meeting.

Privacy and confidentiality

#. All Committee discussions and decisions are public, except when a need for confidentiality has been identified.

   Personal information, such as social security numbers or bank account details, should always be kept confidential.

   (Agreed `2019-12-20`__.)

Tracking work in progress
=========================

#. All hiring activities will be tracked by means of issues in the ``astropy/astropy-project`` GitHub repository.
   The issue description will contain a brief description of the scope of work.

   (Agreed `2020-03-06`__.)

   __ https://docs.google.com/document/d/193ERJ6wMNPaNjGSWbS94KHGnojpZ_zwXxWTi9L2etSo/edit#bookmark=id.4jdhskegwqo5

#. The ``astropy/astropy-project`` GitHub issue tracker, together with the ``finance`` label, will be used to provide status on all major committee work.
   The intention is that these issues are more than a simple “todo list” for the committee, but that they provide a way for the community to see how the various projects the committee are engaged upon are progressing.
   As such, we expect that most issues will remain open for the duration of the project in question.
   For example, an issue regarding funding for a conference will remain open until the conference is over and all necessary reporting has been completed.
   Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis for projects which are unusually long or complex, such as funding proposals which might span multiple years.

   (Agreed `2020-10-16`__.)

   __ https://docs.google.com/document/d/193ERJ6wMNPaNjGSWbS94KHGnojpZ_zwXxWTi9L2etSo/edit#bookmark=id.nlqigxp8k6c

Access to project resources
===========================

#. Astropy is expected to maintain an account with an online password management service, which will include an area for recording account details relevant to the Committee.
   At least two members of the Committee should have access to this vault at any given time.

   (Agreed `2020-06-26`__.)

   __ https://docs.google.com/document/d/193ERJ6wMNPaNjGSWbS94KHGnojpZ_zwXxWTi9L2etSo/edit#bookmark=id.9k7wgfaxak2d

Rates and charges
=================

#. When contracting with an external entity for a project member's effort, an additional 30% will normally be added to the basic cost to cover general project expenses.

   (Agreed `2021-09-17`__.)
