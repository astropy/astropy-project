# Affiliated package documents

This folder holds documents and policies about the Astropy Affiliated package process.

As per [APE 22](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE22.rst) that was
accepted in January 2024, Astropy now partners with [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/)
in this process.

To that effect, most of the process now follows what pyOpenSci has established here:

:cherry_blossom: https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/ :cherry_blossom:

And here:

:star: https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/ :star:

This folder *complements* the above:

* `affiliated_package_review_guidelines.md` lays out Astropy-specific guidelines
  on top of what pyOpenSci reviewers already look for in their checklists.
