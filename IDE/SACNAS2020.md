# Title

Astropy Ambassadors at SACNAS 2020

## Summary 

SACNAS (formerly known as the Society for the Advancement of Chicano
and Native American Scientists) holds a conference each year, which is
the ["largest multidisciplinary and multicultural STEM diversity event
in the country"](https://www.2020sacnas.org/).

This year, the event will be held in a virtual conference setting,
October 19-24. The conference features motivational keynote speakers,
science sessions that highlight students and scholars of color,
professional development sessions, and indigenous cultural
celebrations.

## Team 

Proposal Lead: Lia Corrales (@eblur)

Attendees: The following people would like to attend the conference
this year on behalf of the Astropy

1. Kelle Cruz

2. Erik Tollerud

3. Robel Geda

4. 

## Plan

We will assemble a group Astropy Ambassadors to attend the
conference. Their goals will be to learn from talks and network with
SACNAS attendees. This will help us to develop plans for future
Astropy engagement at SACNAS, for example, developing a science
session proposal for next year.

## Impact

Networking at SACNAS will give the Astropy project visibility and
create opportunities for coders from underrepresented groups to engage
with Astropy. Astropy Ambassadors will also serve as informal mentors
for these individuals to create their first Issue, Pull Request, or
other contribution to the Astropy project.

## Budget

[Registration fees](https://www.2020sacnas.org/registration/) (period Sept 1 - Sept 27) are as follows:
* Student ($205)
* Postdoc ($310)
* Professional ($430)

We anticipate at least 4 professional attendees to rise to the call,
for a total of $1720. Adjustments will be made in this PR, depending
on the amount of interest. We anticipate approval by September 15.
