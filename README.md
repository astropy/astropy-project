# Astropy Project-wide repository

Documents and policies regarding the Astropy Project as a whole.  *Drafts* of policies under consideration go into the `drafts` directory.  Other directories can be created as needed to maintain organization, but as a general guideline a new directory should not be created unless it contains (or will contain) at least 3 files.

Additionally, the issue tracker will be used to discuss larger Project-wide issues; i.e., those that are not particular to a specific pacakge or other repository.
