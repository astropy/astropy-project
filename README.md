# Astropy Project-wide repository

Documents and policies regarding the Astropy Project as a whole.  *Drafts* of policies under consideration go into the `drafts` directory.  Other directories can be created as needed to maintain organization, but as a general guideline a new directory should not be created unless it contains (or will contain) at least 3 files.

* `affiliated`: Astropy Affiliated Package review policies and guidelines.
* `finance`: Astropy Finance Committee policies, proposals, and other documents.
* `infrastructure`: Astropy infrastructure documents.
* `messages`: Templates for communications related to current active policies.
* `policies`: Astropy Project policies, including but not limited to roles, elections, and permissions.
* `roadmap`: Astropy Project roadmap, to be updated annually at the Astropy Coordination Meeting.

Additionally, the issue tracker will be used to discuss larger Project-wide issues; i.e., those that are not particular to a specific pacakge or other repository.
