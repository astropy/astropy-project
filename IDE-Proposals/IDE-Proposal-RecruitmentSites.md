# Title
A one-stop diversity focused reference site for hiring managers.

## Summary 
We are all trying to get more Blacks and underrepresented minorities into our workplaces. We need hiring managers to start advertising in different places. The current places are clearly not bringing in the diverse candidate pool we need. Too often hiring managers say they have advertised broadly, that is not what we need, they need to advertise to a niche.

## Team 
Finding the jobs sites and building the database is work that a minority student could be paid to do. 
Building the associated website with advanced search functionality could be work performed by a minority computer science student.
In both cases preferably from a HBCU.
The work has been started by volunteers: https://ranpalgill.github.io/HUM/
I would like to manage the team and activities.

## Plan
This proposal is to create a searchable list of jobs sites that have a committment to minorities. Where we come to look for open positions knowing that employers have specifically sought out to post their opening on a jobs site that is committed to serving minorities. For job seekers to know they are in a safe space applying to committed employers.
First order is to build the list of sites. Second order is to build a website that allows advanced search of the data. Finally this tool needs to get into the hands of recruiters and hiring managers. 
Stretch goals could be for jobs seekers and hiring managers to be able to review and comment on the jobs sites for their effectiveness.

## Impact
It deals with a bottle neck in the process of getting underrepresented minorities into the astro and STEM fields/workplaces in general, if the work of this proposal can help to improve diverse hiring, attract  minority talent to the field then it ultimately helps with diversity of the AstroPy community and project.

## Budget
Paying students to search for the data to build the database of sites and also to create a searchable website. Purchasing a URL and hosting (optional). This is the section of the proposal that I need help to flesh out.
