- add/remove the following people for role XXX in the Astropy project:

See https://www.astropy.org/team for a list of current roles. Following APE 0 [1] we leave a two week long comment period for this proposal where you can comment publicly on the PR [2] or privately to the CoCo (coordinators@astropy.org or DM one of them on Slack). If there are no objections after two weeks, the CoCo will merge the PR [3].

Sincerely,
Name
(for the CoCo)

[3] Technically, APE0 only requires the two-week long comment period for additions, but following the same spirit, the CoCo also invites comments for removal unless the person in a role explicitly requested to be removed or did not respond to consecutive role surveys.
