Hello {NAME},

You have been nominated as {role} and the Coordinating Committee has enthusiastically accepted this nomination! We would be thrilled if you are able to accept this nomination. {More context might be necessary for some people - fill it in here}

In case you are not familiar with the role, maintainers are the people who keep a package or sub-package working. In particular, they review and merge PRs, keep track of what's going on and organize ideas for future development (see https://www.astropy.org/team.html#Subpackage_maintainer for details). In practice this means a fair amount of community interaction when reviewing PRs and related discussion.  As a general guideline, if you have any uncertainty or if there is extended debate about merging a PR, seek consensus from other maintainers in the Project.  If necessary, you should also free to reach out to the Coordination Committee (by @-mention on github or via coordinators@astropy.org), as the Coordination Committee has the authority to make decisions when consensus cannot be achieved.

If you would like to accept this nomination, we ask that you familiarize yourself with the following Project guidelines:

* [Developer guidelines for Astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/#developer-documentation)
* [Basic development workflow](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/workflow/development_workflow.html)
* [Guidelines on when to squash or rebase](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/when_to_rebase.html)
* [Astropy Project Code of Conduct](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html)
* [GitHub two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication)

If you accept, please respond indicating that you've reviewed the developer documentation and that you have read and agree to abide by the Code of Conduct. After we receive that email from you, we will make an announcement and there will be a two week period of comment. After that period is over, your name will be added to the team webpage and you will be given the appropriate Github permissions.

If you are not on the list already, we also encourage you to join the [astropy-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/astropy-dev), and start trying to attend the monthly developer telecons.

Congratulations on the nomination and thanks for your contributions! We very much hope you accept it. We're very happy to answer any questions you may have about the role.

For the coordinating committee,
{YOUR NAME}
