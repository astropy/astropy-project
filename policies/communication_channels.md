# Communication channels in the Astropy Project

## Preface

Communication in the Astropy Project is governed by the [Community
Code of Conduct](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html), which
takes precedence over anything written here. This goal of this policy is
to write down the technical details of how email lists, Slack
channels, forums etc. are set up.

While we aim to be an inclusive and welcoming community, we
recognize that not all users want to be involved in the technical
details of building and running a library like Astropy. Therefore, some
communication channels that are more geared towards users and others
to developers. Also, in a project this size, certain issues that
arise require privacy (e.g. personal or financial information is
legally protected in many contries). Thus, there are communication
channels geared towards or exclusively for developers, maintainers, or
members of certain committees.


## Email communication geared towards project members

The following mailing lists are maintained as Google groups. Unless
specifically restricted, anyone worldwide can subscribe to these lists,
and previous posts are publicly available. List
membership is required to post messages to prevent spam.

- astropy-dev
- astropy-affiliated-maintainers 
- astropy-core-maintainer: Membership: Anyone with commit rights to the github/astropy/astropy repository
- astropy-gsoc-mentors-XXX: Membership: Mentors of Astropy GSOC projects and astropy GSOC coordinator, coordination committee

In order to be as open as possible, none of these lists
shall be moderated and nor will posts by group members be otherwise
restricted. However, the Coordination Committee can implement a "cool
down" period of no more than 48 hours if they deem
it necessary to maintain a respectful and welcoming
atmosphere. During this period, posting may be moderated or otherwise restricted
by the Coordination Committee. The beginning and end
of such a period has to be announced by the Coordination Committee on
the affected mailing list. The Coordination Committee shall not
implement a "cool down" within a week of any scheduled Astropy vote
unless in the most obvious cases of Code of Conduct violations.


The following email lists / aliases are restricted to members of the respective committee and are not public:

- coordinators@astropy.org: Coordination Committee
- confidential@astropy.org: Ombudsperson
- finance@astropy.org: Interim Finance Committee


## Astropy Slack channels
Anyone can join the Astropy Slack workspace and join any number of channels, unless specifically restricted. The following channels are restricted:

- gsoc-mentors: Same restriction as analogous mailing list

Posting to all channels is open to all workspace members and shall
not be restricted. The Coordination Committee can implement a "cool
down" period following the same rules as established for email lists
above.
