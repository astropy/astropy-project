# Communication channels in the Astropy Project

## Preface

Communication in the Astropy Project is governed by the [Community
Code of Conduct](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html), which
takes precedence over anything written here. This goal of this policy is
to write down the technical details of how email lists, Slack
channels, forums etc. are set up.

While we aim to be an inclusive and welcoming community, we
recognize that not all users want to be involved in the technical
details of building and running a library like Astropy. Therefore, some
communication channels that are more geared towards users and others
to developers. Also, in a project this size, certain issues that
arise require privacy (e.g. personal or financial information is
legally protected in many countries). Thus, there are communication
channels geared towards or exclusively for developers, maintainers, or
members of certain committees.


## Email communication geared towards project members

Mailing lists are maintained as Google groups or through other list
servers.  Two examples of such lists are astropy@python.org, geared
towards users, and astropy-dev@..., which is intended for more
technical developer discussions.  Unless specifically restricted,
anyone worldwide can subscribe to these lists, and previous posts are
publicly available. List membership is required to post messages to
prevent spam.  In order to be as open as possible, none of these lists
shall be moderated and nor will posts by group members be otherwise
restricted. However, the Coordination Committee or the ombdbusperson
can implement a "cool down" period of no more than 48 hours if they
deem it necessary to maintain a respectful and welcoming
atmosphere. During this period, posting may be moderated or otherwise
restricted by the Coordination Committee or their designee. The
beginning and end of such a period has to be announced by the
Coordination Committee on the affected mailing list. The Coordination
Committee shall not implement a "cool down" within a week of any
scheduled Astropy vote unless in the most obvious cases of Code of
Conduct violations.


The following email lists / aliases are restricted in membership and
their content is not public:

- astropy-core-maintainers: Membership: Anyone with commit rights to the github/astropy/astropy repository
- astropy-gsoc-mentors-XXX: Membership: Mentors of Astropy GSOC projects and astropy GSOC coordinator, coordination committee
- coordinators@astropy.org: Coordination Committee
- confidential@astropy.org: Ombudsperson
- finance@astropy.org: Finance Committee


## Astropy Slack team

Anyone can join the Astropy Slack workspace and join any number of
channels, unless specifically restricted (following the same rules as
restricted email lists).      

Posting to all public channels is open to all workspace members and shall
not be restricted. The Coordination Committee can implement a "cool
down" period following the same rules as established for email lists
above.
