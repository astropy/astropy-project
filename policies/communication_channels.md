# Communication channels in the Astropy Project

## Preface

Communication in the Astropy Project is governed by the [Community
Code of Conduct](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html), which
takes precedence over anything written here. This goal of this policy is
to write down the technical details of how email lists, Slack
channels, forums etc. are set up.

While we aim to be an inclusive and welcoming community, we
recognize that not all users want to be involved in the technical
details of building and running a library like Astropy. Therefore, some
communication channels that are more geared towards users and others
to developers. Also, in a project this size, certain issues that
arise require privacy (e.g. personal or financial information is
legally protected in many countries). Thus, there are communication
channels geared towards or exclusively for developers, maintainers, or
members of certain committees.


## Email communication geared towards project members

Mailing lists are maintained as Google groups or through other list
servers. Unless specifically restricted, anyone worldwide can
subscribe to these lists, and previous posts are publicly
available. List membership is required to post messages to prevent
spam.  In order to be as open as possible, none of these lists shall
be moderated and nor will posts by group members be otherwise
restricted. However, the Coordination Committee can implement a "cool
down" period of no more than 48 hours if they deem it necessary to
maintain a respectful and welcoming atmosphere. During this period,
posting may be moderated or otherwise restricted by the Coordination
Committee or their designee. The beginning and end of such a period has to be announced
by the Coordination Committee on the affected mailing list. The
Coordination Committee shall not implement a "cool down" within a week
of any scheduled Astropy vote unless in the most obvious cases of Code
of Conduct violations.


The following email lists / aliases are restricted in memebership and
their content is not public:

- astropy-core-maintainers: Membership: Anyone with commit rights to the github/astropy/astropy repository
- astropy-gsoc-mentors-XXX: Membership: Mentors of Astropy GSOC projects and astropy GSOC coordinator, coordination committee
- coordinators@astropy.org: Coordination Committee
- confidential@astropy.org: Ombudsperson
- finance@astropy.org: Finance Committee


## Astropy Slack channels

Anyone can join the Astropy Slack workspace and join any number of channels, unless specifically restricted. The following channels are restricted:

- gsoc-mentors: Same restriction as analogous mailing list

Posting to all channels is open to all workspace members and shall
not be restricted. The Coordination Committee can implement a "cool
down" period following the same rules as established for email lists
above.
