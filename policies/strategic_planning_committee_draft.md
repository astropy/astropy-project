Are you interested to join Astropy Strategic Planning Committee?
Here is what to expect.

## Time commitment

* Meet at least monthly. Each meeting could be 30-60 minutes long.
  Notes should be publicly available.
* Must be willing to attend the annual Astropy Coordination Meeting, either
  in-person or remotely. This is about a week. Or if you join remotely just
  for certain sessions, then a few days.
* Outside of meetings, must be willing to invest time in actually accomplishing
  duties laid out below. Time estimate is tough here because it depends on
  workload at a given time, and how that load is divided among committee members.
  Maybe no more than a few days a month?
* Some of the duties might involve even more meetings (e.g., reaching out to
  specific communities). Time estimate is quite impossible to predict at this point.
  No more than 1-2 weeks a year?

## Expectations

You have to be willing to perform duties as laid out in https://www.astropy.org/team#strategic_planner,
i.e., do long-term planning for the Astropy Project as a whole, including:

* Shape and provide a vision for next major steps in the Project, in consultation with the whole Astropy community.
* Maintain an overview of all the project activities (both from developer and user perspectives).
* Provide points of contact for external stakeholders on the above (with the Coordination Committee).
* Monitor project activities to see how well aligned they are with the roadmap and strategic goals of the project, and report back to the community and Coordination Committee.
* Coordinate writing grant proposals (in collaboration with the Finance Committee, Coordination Committee, and community).
* Maintain the Astropy Project Roadmap.
* Engage with, and collect input from, the whole Astropy Community on project vision and priorities.

Deliverables based on Team page duties:

* Progress reports, as needed. At the very least, annually during Astropy Coordination Meeting.
* Grant proposals, as needed. At most once a year?
* Roadmap in https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/tree/main/roadmap.
* Project boards?
* Documentation, communication, or assets necessary to accomplish duties above.

Additional ongoing deliverables proposed by CoCo:


* A plan for more support/involvement with radio? NRAO and SKA.
* A plan for more administrative support, e.g, maintain email lists.
* A plan for any additional initiatives the committee feels is important for Astropy's future

## Open questions/concerns

* If no term limit and not elected position, will this committee be hoarded by a few people
  and no opportunity for fresh prespective?
* Does governance of this committee need to be added to APE 0?
* What if some committee members become inactive but refuse to step down or just MIA?
* What are the min and max numbers of people for an effective committee here? Probably want to keep it odd to break ties. 
* Does the group explicitly need a chair to stay organized?

* What if the committee cannot reach a consensus?
* How is the initial membership decided?
