Are you interested to join Astropy Strategic Planning Committee?
Here is what to expect.

## Initial membership / Beta test year

* Coordination Commitee will solicit interest from the community.
* From the interested parties, Coordination Commitee will pick 5 people to form the first committee.
  One of the committee members must serve as liaison to Coordination Commitee.
  One of the committee members must serve as liaison to Finance Committee.
* The first year of the first committee will be the "beta test year."

During the beta test year, this committee should sort out its governance,
including but not limited to:

* Are 5 people a good number for the committee? If not, what number is?
* How does committee pick its liaisons?
* Does the committee need a chairperson? This person does not have to be
  one of the liaisons.
* Determine if no term limit and not an elected position, will this committee
  be hoarded by a few people and no opportunity for fresh prespective?
* Determine resolution for if some committee members become inactive but refuse
  to step down or just MIA?
* Determine a process to pick new members for this committee going forward
  (with the above two points in mind).

As with other committees (e.g., Finance Committee) except the Coordination Committee,
the governance of this committee does not need to go into APE 0.

If this committee is unable to reach a consensus, as with other matters in the Project,
the committee may request Coordination Commitee to step in.

## Time commitment

* Meet at least monthly. Each meeting could be 30-60 minutes long.
  Notes should be publicly available.
* Must be willing to attend the annual Astropy Coordination Meeting, either
  in-person or remotely. This is about a week. Or if you join remotely just
  for certain sessions, then a few days.
* Outside of meetings, must be willing to invest time in actually accomplishing
  duties laid out below. Time estimate is tough here because it depends on
  workload at a given time, and how that load is divided among committee members.
  Maybe no more than a few days a month?
* Some of the duties might involve even more meetings (e.g., reaching out to
  specific communities). Time estimate is quite impossible to predict at this point.
  No more than 1-2 weeks a year?

## Expectations

You have to be willing to perform duties as laid out in https://www.astropy.org/team#strategic_planner,
i.e., do long-term planning for the Astropy Project as a whole, including:

* Shape and provide a vision for next major steps in the Project, in consultation with the whole Astropy community.
* Maintain an overview of all the project activities (both from developer and user perspectives).
* Provide points of contact for external stakeholders on the above (with the Coordination Committee).
* Monitor project activities to see how well aligned they are with the roadmap and strategic goals of the project, and report back to the community and Coordination Committee.
* Coordinate writing grant proposals (in collaboration with the Finance Committee, Coordination Committee, and community).
* Maintain the Astropy Project Roadmap.
* Engage with, and collect input from, the whole Astropy Community on project vision and priorities.

Deliverables based on Team page duties:

* Progress reports, as needed. At the very least, annually during Astropy Coordination Meeting.
* Grant proposals, as needed. At most once every few years?
* Roadmap in https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/tree/main/roadmap.
* Project boards?
* Documentation, communication, or assets necessary to accomplish duties above.

Additional ongoing deliverables proposed by Coordination Commitee:

* A plan for more support/involvement with radio? Telescopes include but not limited to
  SKA, SKA pathfinders like ASKAP and LOFAR, ALMA, and a whole panoply of other projects
  of various sizes (CHIME, DSA-2000, etc.). Organizations include but not limited to
  NRAO, ESO, and NAOJ.
* A plan for more administrative support, e.g, maintain email lists.
* A plan for any additional initiatives the committee feels is important for Astropy's future.
