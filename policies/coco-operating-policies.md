# Astropy Coordination Committee Operating Policies

This living document outlines the guiding procedures of the Astropy Coordination
Committee.  Note that this is not meant to be exhaustive nor duplicative - for
example, the running notes doc documents how it is meant to be used itself.
This document instead is meant to describe procedure, and where necessary,
policy, for how the CoCo operates.

## Processes and Responsibilities

- The primary responsibilities, election, and philosophy of the CoCo are described in
[APE0](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst). That content is not 
duplicated here.
- Maintaining role categories. [[Process]](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/policies/adding-new-roles.md)
- Maintaining role assignments. [[Process]](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/policies/adding-new-role-members.md)
- Reviewing and finalizing Astropy Proposals for Enhancement (APEs). [[Process]](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs#finalizing-apes)

## Meeting Details

All meetings are held remotely (using Astropy’s Zoom) except when CoCo members happen to be co-located.

*Frequency*

Meeting frequency can vary depending on required workload with the assent of
the current CoCo.  The minimum expected rate is monthly.

*Quorum*

CoCo1 assumed 2,
and CoCo2 generally informally required 3 although 2 was sometimes sufficient
for urgent or unlikely-to-be-controversial decisions. Coco3 uses a quorum of
3, however, members not present can leave a note in the agenda to ask to hold
an item until they are present. At least positive 3 votes are needed for any
decision.

*Moderation*

There is no dedicated chair.  Rather, the role of chair is taken on a
per-meeting basis by a moderator who both prepares the agenda and moderates
the discussion. The moderator role rotates through all CoCo members on a
specified cycle (with swaps as needed to accommodate
vacations/conflicts/etc).

*Agenda/Notes*

All CoCo members are able to add items to the agenda at any time, subject to
approval of the meeting moderator. Notes are taken in the same document as
the agenda. The CoCo is collectively responsible for the accuracy of the
notes.

## Voting

The CoCo aims for consensus when making decisions.  However if this is
impractical in a timely manner (i.e. the committee is deadlocked), or the
item under discussion is judged to be important enough by assent of the
committee, a vote may be requested. The following are additional useful
guidelines for votes:

+ If a choice is change vs stay the same, status quo should be default - hence ties
  should generally lead to status quo.
+ If the CoCo is deadlocked, the issue may be better put to the broader community or
  the Astropy Voting Membership. This is particularly true for especially “weighty”
  decisions, and the CoCo should feel free to put the question to the broader
  community in place of decision by close votes.

## Outward Communication Channels

+ The running notes should be open.

+ To make announcements to the Astropy community, the CoCo generally relies upon
  relevant mailing lists and forums.  When sending such announcements from the CoCo,
  a CoCo member should be careful to sign a message as:

        For the Astropy Coordination Committee,
        <Name>

+ When sending a message as an individual member of the project (or in one of their
  other roles), they should sign in whatever other way they prefer.

## Internal Communication channels

*Coordinators Mailing List/Google group (coordinators@astropy.org)*

Used for private conversations between the coordinators and specific individuals or
just among the coordinators. There is an expectation that messages in this group might
be private communication.  Hence, without the CoCo’s agreement, these emails are not
to be shared outside of the CoCo, although future CoCos will be able to see them.

*Private Slack channel (`#coordinatorsNN`)*

Used for private, informal conversations among CoCo members. A new channel is created
each time CoCo membership changes. There is a strong expectation of privacy and
messages should not be shared without express permission of the sender.

## GitHub Privileges 

CoCo members typically have owner privileges of the Astropy organization, but it is not mandatory. The accounts which have owner privileges must have two-factor authentication enabled.
