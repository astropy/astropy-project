This document describes the process for adding new people to named roles. This
document is *not* about new roles are added, which is covered under
[adding-new-roles.md](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/policies/adding-new-roles.md).

The process itself is overseen by the Astropy Coordination Committee.
For roles related to Astropy Coordination Committee, Ombudsperson, and Voting Members,
please also see the process laid out in
[APE0](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst).

Maintainers are the people who administer the Project and keep the packages working.
The roles are described in the [Role Responsibilites](https://www.astropy.org/team.html#role-responsibilities)
section of the [Astropy Team](https://www.astropy.org/team.html) page.
Often, they review and merge PRs, keep track of what's going on and
organize ideas for future development. Most roles require particular GitHub permissions,
which is highlighted in the process below.

The process is:

1. A voting member or maintainer in a related role, after consulting with other members in
   related roles, sends a message to the person nominated (with the Coordination Committee
   in the cc), making sure they understand the role, its responsibilities, and confirming
   that the nominee agrees.
   ([suggested text](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/messages/maintainer_access.md)).
2. The nominee should also be asked (generally but not necessarily in the
   message above) to confirm they agree to abide by the Code of Conduct, and that they are
   aware of guidelines relevant to the role.
3. If the nominee does not accept, the process stops here.
4. If the nominee does accept, a PR is made adding the member to the roles page as a 
   place for public comment.
5. A message linking to the PR is sent to the community
   ([suggested text](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/messages/role_annoucement.md)),
   starting a two-week clock on the feedback period
   [as required by APE0](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst#responsibilities-and-authority).
6. Once the two week period has elapsed, the Coordination Committee makes a
   final decision based on any feedback.
7. If the appointment is confirmed, the PR from Step 4 is merged and the nominee is added to the [roles page](https://www.astropy.org/team).
8. The nominee receives the necessary GitHub or other permissions for the new role.
9. The nominee gets added to the astropy-core-maintainers mailing list.
10. The Coordination Committee member sends a confirmation message to the nominee
    to complete the process.
