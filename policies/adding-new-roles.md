This document describes the process for adding new named roles. This
document is *not* about how people are added to the roles, which is covered under
[adding-new-role-members.md](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/policies/adding-new-role-members.md).

The process is:

1. A voting member or maintainer in a related role, after consulting with other members in
   related roles, opens a PR to [astropy.github.com](https://github.com/astropy/astropy.github.com)
   to add this new role. The PR must describe clearly why this role is essential to the Astropy
   Project and has clear description of associated responsibilities. If this role has sub-roles,
   those must be clarified as well in the same manner. This new role must be declared Unfilled
   for now (separation of concerns). This new role cannot duplicate any existing roles.
2. The PR author sends out a notice of this PR to astropy-dev mailing list, with cc to the
   Coordination Committee, starting a two-week clock on the feedback period
   [as required by APE0](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst#responsibilities-and-authority).
3. Once the two week period has elapsed, the Coordination Committee makes a
   final decision based on any feedback.
4. If the new role is confirmed, the PR is merged. Otherwise, it is closed without merge.
5. The Coordination Committee member sends an update to the astropy-dev notice
   with an update, regardless of the decision.
6. If new role is accepted in Step 4, proceed to
   [adding-new-role-members.md](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/policies/adding-new-role-members.md)
   for the next steps.
